We’ve just renewed with them for another year so that shows how pleased I am so far. I can’t give 5 stars though as I’d need to know what happens during the claims process first (which I hope I never know!!!)   \n",

They also quoted the best price for the most coverage. Now, I just bought a home insurance with them, it is easy to give them 5 stars now.

Initially, there was confusion regarding a 10% discount versus a £10 credit. It turns out that the £10 credit was provided as an incentive when I paid more upfront. However, when I downgraded my policy by removing add-ons, they also deducted the £10 credit without proper explanation in actual refund received. The email I received included the total credit refund including promotional £10, but the removal wasn't clearly communicated. I was left confused but eventually it all got explained. At times a quick phone call can be beneficial over emails.   \n",

       "7   Shame as was finally happy with the insurer and had a year without any claims. However the renewal price has gone from £400 to nearly £800.They will undoubtedly just put the usual copy and paste reply where they talk about how their prices to us are based off their costs. However, the fact that they have no costs against my policy but are instead using me to subsidise their other customers as all insurers do is painful.I've left them and gone to another company who is quoting £550 and which I will accept to start in July. It would be great if Urban Jungle would match this or even bother to discuss things but they won't.It's a real shame when a new upstarter that seemed to be so full of promise turns out to be the same insurance fatcat in different clothes. Very disappointing.   \n",

We’ve just renewed with them for another year so that shows how pleased I am so far. I can’t give 5 stars though as I’d need to know what happens during the claims process first (which I hope I never know!!!)   \n",

They also quoted the best price for the most coverage. Now, I just bought a home insurance with them, it is easy to give them 5 stars now. I hope I don't need them but I place a claim and struggle to get what I paid for, I will certainly come back here and review my review.   \n",

Initially, there was confusion regarding a 10% discount versus a £10 credit. It turns out that the £10 credit was provided as an incentive when I paid more upfront. However, when I downgraded my policy by removing add-ons, they also deducted the £10 credit without proper explanation in actual refund received. The email I received included the total credit refund including promotional £10, but the removal wasn't clearly communicated. I was left confused but eventually it all got explained. At times a quick phone call can be beneficial over emails.   \n",

However the renewal price has gone from £400 to nearly £800.They will undoubtedly just put the usual copy and paste reply where they talk about how their prices to us are based off their costs. However, the fact that they have no costs against my policy but are instead using me to subsidise their other customers as all insurers do is painful.I've left them and gone to another company who is quoting £550 and which I will accept to start in July. It would be great if Urban Jungle would match this or even bother to discuss things but they won't.It's a real shame when a new upstarter that seemed to be so full of promise turns out to be the same insurance fatcat in different clothes. Very disappointing.   \n",

A very frustrating experience. Only to find I have several quote summaries already downloaded.....?Despite this I have purchased the insurance quoted and trust the actual provision of the service will prove to be a more positive experience.   \n",

Making a claim is a whole other story, and so far not a good one.Communication is key to customer satisfaction. Claims handler took my details and Emailed me a list of documents needed- I responded within 2 hours and still waiting for a response. I called after a week of waiting only to be told someone will be in touch soon and it’s being looked at. Really? I wasn’t born yesterday, I know how it works. Just need to know what’s going on with my claim and decide if I need to just replace the broken unit out of my own pocket.   \n",

Thought it would be easy to use my existing house insurer. WRONG!Waited 30 mins on phone then used their CHAT line.GAVE UP . Wasted one hour.  Urban Jungle were the opposite delivering a good easy route to give me a good policy starting in 2 days time . Just what I wanted Graas my move to the retirement village was due to my wife's recent death from a rare cancer.   \n",

This generates bias towards an automatic hiring platform. This is NOT what insurance is about. Insurance is about protection, and this you know only when claims happen.The FCA should prohibit these review practices as they are misleading   \n",

But if you claim it for any problems and damages they are rejecting all claims by stating your house is 10 years old you need to maintain. That means they are only looking for brand new house problems. What a shame , can you shut you company don’t fake peoples money.   \n",

After the getting the insurance and having for about 5 months we review notice of contract termination as they no longer insure vehicles. Rather than honour the year out we were told to find new insurance elsewhere.Hours of on hold phone calls only to be told we wouldn’t receive any compensation for the inconvenience and that we had wasted a good 5 months of no claims with them!This as a side note makes me feel that perhaps a six month review regarding no claims should be accepted rather than just full years!They then have the audacity to flood my email with offers of other insurance they can offer me and look forward to my business with them in the future.I don’t think so guys.

Due to my situation at the time I didn't have the time to search again for other quotes and my current insurance due to expire I had no other option but to take their insurance. However, I will not be taking it out when it comes to renewal !   \n",

That invalidated the policy and Urban Jungle insisted I go through another quotation and pay for a second policy before refunding the first. They also wanted the second quotation at a different price through their own system which invalidates the Go Compare Rewards. Not the way to do business and not worth hassle. Went back to Direct Line who are far more professional.   \n",

So far Urban Jungle have been fine. Cheap price and as simple as many when I applied.However I don’t know how good they are until I come to claim. Are they cheap because they are more efficient, because they take less profit or because you will struggle to get them to pay up? I don’t know yetThey did push me quite hard to leave a review…so I would say take these scores with a pinch of salt, it is probably mainly from people who are yet to claim.   \n",

Everything was explained very clearly what was covered in each policy and how much it would be. If you didn't want or need the extra added charges you simply don't choose them but if you do the extra charges were very reasonable add-ons. Had never heard of this company to be honest however I would highly recommend them from now on.   \n",

Paid the initial deposit to then get a notification from my bank saying the deposit had gone back in my bank. I had to ring them to find out they were cancelling my insurance. Joke of a company, people try to get insurance in a timely manner because it’s cheaper to get it before it’s due to renew, then had to wait about for my deposit back.   \n",
