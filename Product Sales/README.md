## Key Insights

### Business Goals
The primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different sales approaches (Email, Call, Email + Call) in terms of:
- Customer reach
- Revenue generation
- Product sales volume

### Outcomes
1. **Customer Reach**: 
   - Over 7,000 customers were contacted via Email.
   - Just under 5,000 customers were contacted via Call.
   - About 2,500 customers were contacted using both Email + Call.
   - **Focus**: Increase the combined Email + Call strategy as it has room for improvement.

2. **Revenue Spread**:
   - Overall: Most revenue lies between £25 and £120.
   - Per Method:
     - **Email + Call**: Generated significantly higher revenue, with a range of £145–£240.
     - **Email**: Achieved revenue above £100, with outliers exceeding £130.
     - **Call**: Generated the least revenue, mostly under £50.

3. **Trends Over Time**:
   - **Email + Call** showed the greatest increase in revenue over time.
   - Periodic dips were noted, with no sales method showing consistent week-to-week growth.

4. **Product Sales**:
   - Emails sold the highest number of products, likely due to efficiency and scalability.
   - Calls followed closely, with Email + Call being slightly less effective in volume despite higher revenue per sale.
