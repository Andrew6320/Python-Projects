Deep Learning with Fashion MNIST

Description:  
In this project, I developed a Python application to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark dataset for image classification. This project involved importing and pre-processing the datas§et, defining the CNN architecture, applying regularization techniques, and evaluating the model's performance.

Key Features:

Dataset Handling:
  - Utilized the Fashion MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
  - Divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, with a 20% validation split.

Data Visualisation:
  - Visualised sample images using a 2D colour plot to understand the dataset better and verify data integrity.

CNN Model Design:
  - Implemented a CNN with layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected operations.
  - Used L2 regularization to improve the model’s generalisation by reducing overfitting.

Training and Evaluation:
  - Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test set, significantly improving from the baseline accuracy through regularization.
 
Skills Demonstrated:
- Proficiency in Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
- Ability to design and train convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks.
- Experience with data pre-processing and visualization techniques.
- Understanding of regularization methods and their impact on model performance.
